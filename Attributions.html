            <p>SCU-China is founded in 2012,with the support of the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.The team exists as a scholar club in the university and it really provides a platform for all students to show their passions and potentials.Some guys have been working in the team for a few years,making the whole team really a big family.</p>
            <p>This year,we get students from ten different colleges and it gives us the chances to know different majors and work together.We really enjoy the time and it leaves such a deep impression on everyone who contributes here.We design all our projects independently by ourselves.</p>
            <p>Though we haven't got any gold medal as far,we gained a lot from the process.We really enjoy the iGEM competition.</p>

And we got the copyrights from the original song writer “iLem” on Sina Weibo to cover the original song “Ordinary Disco”, which is quite famous in China. Check this out!</p>

                    <p class="transparent">This is the third year for me to be an iGEMer. Honestly, iGEM plays a critical role during my college years. From a team member for last two years, to the team leader (the group leader of CecropinXJ expression group as well) for this year, I have learnt too much from iGEM. Personally speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research, and how to collaborate with others in lab environment. My passion towards research will be continued even after I've become a former iGEMer.</p>

I really appreciate the recognization of me. I want to thank all the team members. It's you guys who company me through the whole year. The experience of working together for one goal will become an important part of my student life forever. And I've decided to enter a synthetic biology lab to study further in this field.</p>

In retrospect of last year, I have learned rudimentary molecular experiment skills from our precedents. During this year, I get myself familiar with other advanced skills such as Gibson Assembly, OE OCR and qPCR. I believe that the headquarter of iGEM gives us a scope to image our own biology machine freedomly although for a short while.  At last, I would like to appreciate Miss. LUO as a crucial precedent to guide me into this interesting molecular biology realm.</p>

I'm the main member of Aarc expression group for this year. During the experiment process, honestly, there always troubles and problems come out. But they taught us a lot after we get through. In short, iGem gives me a hot sense of uplift in research and the joy of experiment.</p>

                    <p class="transparent">As a sophomore, this is my first year to be an iGEMer. Through the past whole year, I gradually knew the meaning of this competition. I felt amazed about how attractive and challenging this competetion could be. In terms of the experiments, I worked in the CecropinXJ expression group. During the whole process, I gained not only the experimental skills, but also the importance of team work. I do appreciate the unforgettable experience which this competetion offered me, and I believe it will be a precious gift through my life.</p>

                    <p class="transparent">This  is the first year for me to be an iGEMer. I joined it as soon as I came to my college because I really like it where I can have a good method and skill in the experiment. What's more, I enjoy the atmosphere when we cooperate with each other by means of group discussion, seminars and doing experiment together. Honestly speaking, I  learned a lot in this year and am planning to go further and deeper in this interesting area.</p>

                    <p class="transparent">It's my first time to take part in the iGEM. In summer, I stay in the lab for a month. I have never worked for a long time in the lab before and this is really a valuable experience in my life. I have learned how to keep everything ready so our work won't be delayed frequently. Also, I gained many interesting friends and found many delicious foods around my collage : ). To me, iGEM is an excellent chance to do our own experiments but never worry about the funds and results. Thanks to iGEM. Thanks to SCU. Thanks to the Lifescience school.</p>

                    <p class="transparent">Undeniably, when it comes to the most unique experience I have gained as a freshman, the time I spend on iGEM should be mentioned. Worked in acetate metabolism and human practice groups, I'm glad to acquire so much synthetic biology knowledge, experiment skills from responsible seniors, and get used to teamwork. iGEM provides us with an excellent stage to design, demonstrate, and present the project, which deeply attracts me. When we design the project with inspirations and creativity, the synthetic biology is definitely brought to life.</p>

                    <p class="transparent">It's my honour to become an iGEMer as a freshman in SCU. Not only do I improve my experimental skills,but also make new friends and really get fun. The comprehensive help given by senior, the cheer with partners in human practice and the felling of designing something now--these are what I love that attract me. And I wish I will always keep my passion going along this road. </p>
