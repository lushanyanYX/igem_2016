            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This year, our team project aimed at designing an innovative insole called "Comfootable" to prevent foot odor and foot infection of microorganisms by two strains of engineered E.coli. Compared with the conventional chemical treatment, biological method shows high specificity and long effectiveness. Yet, the traditional bacterial media was limited to be used as the substrate of our insole for it’s low mechanical strength and poor water retention ability. Also，present materials used in the insoles also were not suitable to culture bacteria. To address these problems to manage our innovative insole, we synthesized several new types of hydrogels (Nano Composite hydrogels and Double Network hydrogels.) having a good performance on water absorption, water retention, mechanical strength and biocompatibility. In addition, we designed and produced some innovative insoles and constantly improve them with the help and feedback of our users. </p>

            <h2>Material</h2>
            <p>Agar/PAAm DN gel</p>
            <p>Agar/PAM DN hydrogels were synthesized using a one-pot, heating-cooling-photopolymerization method. all reactants of AM (7 mol L1, 4.9756 g), agar (17mgmL1, 0.17 g),initiator HMP (0.4 mol%ofAM, 0.0639g), and crosslinker MBA (0.028 mol% of AM, 3.02 mg) were added into a tube. After three cycles of degassing, 10 mL of degassed water were added. The tube was then sealed under N2 protection and heated up to 95 1C to dissolve agar in a water bath, forming a transparent precursor solution. Then, the solution was injected into a glass mold with a 1 mm thick PTFE spacer and gradually cooled down to room temperature. During the cooling process, agar formed the first physically crosslinked network via physically-associated agar helical bundles. Once the first agar network was formed, the agar gel and other unreacted species in the same pot were photo-polymerized for B1 hour using UV light (wavelength: 365 nm, intensity: 8 W, UVP,CA)to form the second chemically cross-linked network of PAM that interpenetrates with the first agar network. Gels were removed from the molds afterwards and sealed with a plastic wrap to keep moisture before tensile testing. Unlike the conventional two or multiple-step methods, this one-pot process takes only 1–2 hours to complete DN gels. Agar single network (SN) hydrogels and PAM SN hydrogels were prepared using the modified one-pot method. Agar SN gels were synthesized using the heating up-and-cooling down process without involving photo-polymerization, while PAM SN hydrogels were directly synthesized using the photo-polymerization method. We also prepared the Agar/PAM DN and SN parent gels at different concentrations of AM, agar, initiator, and crosslinker to examine their effects on the mechanical and antifouling properties.</p>

            <h2>Insole model</h2>
            <h2>Insole 1</h2>
            <p>Insole 1 has a resin based skeleton with Polyurethane sponge crammed in the hole of it. The resin skeleton support most of the weight of the feet. While the Polyurethane sponge acts as the mix solid-liquid culture media of the engineered E.coli. When force is applied on the insole, the skeleton will deform slightly , therefore the solution containing the cecropin XJ will be squeezed out to kill the bacteria on people’s feet, which is efficient for mass transferring.</p>

            <h2>Insole 2</h2>
            <p>Insole 2 is a hydrogel based insole. The principle part is a whole foot shape insole made by one type hydrogel containing the nutrients required by the growth of bacteria . Two strains are mixed together in the insole system to grow.</p>

            <h2>Insole 3</h2>
            <p>Insole 3 also has a hydrogel based main part.  Yet, it is divided into two different parts to realize different functions. The first part locates in the areas where most force apply when people are moving,like the sole ,heel and the toe. In this area, high mechanical strength gel containing bacteria lysis solution made the skeleton, with the particle of super absorbent polymers ( SAP particle) on the top gap of it. These SAP particles swelled with culture solution can provide enough nutrients for the bacterial growth. The first type E.coli witch can produce Cecropin XJ grow on the surface of the SAP particles.when temperature beyond the critical value, it will lyse to release the Cecropin to realize the antibacterial function. The other area of the insole consists of the another hydrogel contain less water with the second type E.coli grow on it can absorb the foot sweat of people to reach the goal of both deodorant and arefaction.</p>

          <p>Figure shows that at a low AAm concentration of 3 mol/L (a), the tensile stress of DN gels increased from 0.15-0.6MPa. At higher AAm concentrations, DN gels prepared exhibited high mechanical stress of 0.4-0.9MPa at AAm 5mol/L(b) and 0.3-1.2MPa at AAm 7mol/L(C),indicating that the increase of the AAm concentration can enhance the fracture stress of DN gels. Besides, the failure tensile stress was generally improved with the increase of agar concentrations at AAm concentrations of 3 mol/L. However, it presented another pattern at high AAm concentration. Instead of increasing all the time, there was an turning point at the agar concentration of 17mg/mL, where both reached the maxium tensile stress of 0.87MPa (b), 1.25MPa (c).Then, we specifically examined the effects of AAm concentrations on the mechanical properties at the feeding concentration of agar 17mg/L.</p>
